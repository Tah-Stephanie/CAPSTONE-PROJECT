## Introduction
This Power BI project is a Capstone project which aims at analysing data from an unknown store called “Global Superstore”. The project report answered all the business questions which will in turn help in drawing out meaningful insight from the Superstore dataset which would aid management in making informed decisions to improve performance and profitability. 
**_ Disclaimer_** The dataset used do not represent any company or country but just as imaginary data used to perform some analysis

### Problem statement

Question 1. a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014? b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product? 

Question 2. a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States. 

Question 3. a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

 Question 5. a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low? 

Question 6. a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
 
Question 7. a)Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

### Modelling
![](https://github.com/Tah-Stephanie/CAPSTONE-PROJECT/blob/main/Data%20Model%20Global%20superstore.png)
The sourced dataset had 3 tables, all which were fact tables hence no direct relationship could be established between them.

Using power query, a calendar table was created which was then directed linked to one of the fact table ‘Orders’.

The model type was a star schema because we had one dimension table linked to one fact table. The 2 other fact tables did not have any active relationship and were also not useful for our analysis.

## Visualisations
The report is made up of 2 pages which answers the 7 business questions
